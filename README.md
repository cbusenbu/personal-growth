# personal-growth
A place where I can track some progress on stuff I want to do/things to make me just a better person

This is primarily tracked with Issues, and linked to my personal kanban board for growth opportunities.

## Why I chose this method

With hub, i have a really easy way to create issues, and templates for them. I don't have to create an API for tasks or anything like that, and I really want some history for what I continue to work on. I really want to see the gradual steps I make in my career, as it's difficult to see small changes over an extended period of time, without actually keeping track of it.

## Tagging
There will be tags that apply to the issues as noted here:
  Will continually update these.
